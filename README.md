An interactive story written in python

My name is 78,

This is my first project, my version of "hello-world".

Throughout the process of learning Python, I will be updating this so as to act as a record of what I can do. It also couldn't hurt to learn to develope software with other people. 

This will be an open project and story that people can add and edit to as they like. The first part is simple text, and at the end, I hope to be able to add a GUI version to it.

The assets are open for use, there are no tight lock restrictions to use of characters or anything. I hope to make this completely open such that the art assets will contain the original art/animation files (.fla, .svg, .ai, etc) so the story can be fully customized. 

The original version of this story was made for a google interactive story project for schools. I decided to make it a program because... well... why not?

I hope to learn a lot here, and make something that works.
